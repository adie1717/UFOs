# UFOs
## Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to help Dana create visual and dynamic content of UFO sightings and provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings.

## Filters and results
By allowing users to filter by city, state, country, and shape, she can provide a comprehensive view of her findings. 
Users who visit the UFO Finder web page are able to select multilple criteria to narrow down their UFO sightings results. 
In order to execute the search, users can opt from the following filters; date, city , state country and shape. This allows users to identify patterns in sightings and perhaps also narrow down the state and city of the most frequent occurences. 

One drawback of the analysis is that the table does not allow the user to filter by all datapoints. Including the 'duration' as a option, would be helpful for users wanting to see sightings of shorter or longer duration.
